# 🎵 Spotify Music Analysis & Prediction System 🚀

This project dives into a dataset of songs and their features to **analyze music trends**, **predict genres**, and **group similar songs into playlists based on mood**. Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to replicate Spotify's prediction system and uncover insights into music preferences over the years. 🎧
